# Binary Analysis Tool (BAT) Cheatsheet

BAT is a framework for automated binary code analysis, providing a unified interface for various binary analysis tools.

## Installation

BAT can be installed using pip:

```
pip install bat-framework
```

## Usage

BAT allows you to perform various binary analysis tasks using a command-line interface. Here are some common commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bat info <binary>` | Display basic information about the binary, such as architecture, file type, and entry point. |
| `bat disassemble <binary>` | Disassemble the binary and display the assembly code. |
| `bat strings <binary>` | Extract strings from the binary. |
| `bat symbols <binary>` | List the symbols (functions, variables, etc.) in the binary. |
| `bat xrefs <binary>` | Display cross-references (where a function or variable is used). |
| `bat cfg <binary>` | Generate and visualize the control flow graph of the binary. |
| `bat decompile <binary>` | Decompile the binary and display the high-level code. |
| `bat emulate <binary>` | Emulate the execution of the binary. |
| `bat taint <binary>` | Perform taint analysis on the binary. |
| `bat angr <binary>` | Use the Angr framework for binary analysis. |
| `bat radare2 <binary>` | Use the Radare2 framework for binary analysis. |

You can also use BAT to write custom analysis scripts using Python. The framework provides a set of APIs for interacting with various binary analysis tools.
